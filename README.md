### Jenkins image with added tools for running and building a standart PHP app

The image contains PHP7.4 and Composer. 

#### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

This project uses public images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)

#### Run Jenkins locally 
```
docker-compose up
```

### Jenkins deployment in the cloud - example with Cloudfoundry

Login to CloudFoundry from CLI [CF CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html):

```
cf login
```

Start a Jenkins instance using this image:

```
cf push jenkins-server --docker-image boneff/jenkins-docker-php
```

To setup Jenkins - get the initial admin password from the logs:

```
cf logs jenkins-server --recent | grep -B 1 -A 2 "following password"
```

As a final step - go to the route which was generated by the CLI command and set up Jenkins.
A know limitation - if you use a trial account for CF you will not have an available persistrage.ent sto
Thus you will not be able to mount a local folder to your Jenkins container and will lose builds, settings and etc. on restart. 
But still - as a proof of concept this setup is good enough.


#### Built with
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
